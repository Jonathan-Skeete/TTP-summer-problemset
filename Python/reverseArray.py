"""
    *   Name: reverseArray.py
    *
    *   Given an list of integers, write a function that returns nothing,
    *   but reverses the order of the elements in the list.
    *   For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    *   the function should modify the list to be [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
    *   Constraints: Do not create another list, and do not use the built-in reverse() method.
    *   Hint: in python a, b = b, a assigns the value of b to a and the value of a to b.
