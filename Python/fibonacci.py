    *   Name: fibonacci.py
    *   
    *   Define the function fibonacci() that takes an integer argument and
    *   returns a list of integers containing the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    *   The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number
    *   is the sum of the previous two.
    *   For example, if the function is called with an argument of 10, the
    *   return value should be a list containing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:
    *   {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34}.
    * 
    *   Suggestions: Consider using recursion to solve this problem.
