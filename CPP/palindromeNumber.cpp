/*
    *   Name: palindromeNumber.cpp
    *   
    *   Define the function isPalindrome() that takes an integer argument and
    *   returns true if the number is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
    *   A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.
    *   For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.
    *   Also, negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
    * 
    *   Constraints: Do not convert the integer to a string to solve this problem.
    *   Challenge: Try to solve this problem without allocating extra space.
    *   Hint: The numbers of digits in an integer can be calculated using:
    *   floor(log10(num)) + 1
